# crm-ai-nudge-lab
 A research sandbox for testing AI-powered nudging in CRM systems using Microsoft Power Platform


---

## ✨ About the Project
This repository supports a Master's thesis project focused on exploring how AI-generated nudging techniques can improve task performance and reduce cognitive overload in CRM systems. The implementation and testing take place in a Power Platform environment, simulating realistic use cases in enterprise CRM workflows.

---

## 🎓 Research Context
CRM systems are often underutilized due to complex interfaces and fragmented user flows. This project explores AI-powered nudges—smart reminders, contextual prompts, and task-specific interventions—as a way to support productivity, reduce cognitive load, and simplify navigation.

### Research Question
> How can AI-powered nudging improve task performance and user efficiency in CRM systems?

### Objectives
- Evaluate which types of nudges improve task speed and accuracy.
- Analyze how nudging reduces friction in navigation.
- Develop a demo CRM use case powered by Power Platform.

## ⚙️ Tech Stack
- **Microsoft Power Platform** (Model-Driven App / Canvas App)
- **Power Automate** for triggering nudges
- **AI Builder / GPT API** (for future iterations)
- **Python / Jupyter Notebooks** (for data simulation and A/B test analysis)

## 🤺 Usage
Once the demo app is ready, you can:
1. Import the Power App into your own Power Platform environment
2. Trigger nudging logic via Power Automate
3. Run tasks with and without nudges
4. Log task times and analyze via notebooks
